		The file command is used to identify a particular file according to the
		type of data contained by the file. File can identify many different
		file types, including ELF binaries, system libraries, RPM packages, and
		many different graphics formats.

		This utility is essential for analyzing binaries and file formats on the
		target system, especially useful for debugging cross-compilation issues.
