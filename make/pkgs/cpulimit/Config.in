		cpulimit is a tool which limits the CPU usage of a process (expressed
		in percentage, not in CPU time). It is useful to control batch jobs,
		when you don't want them to eat too many CPU cycles. The goal is to
		prevent a process from running for more than a specified time ratio.
		
		It does not change the nice value or other scheduling priority settings,
		but the real CPU usage. Also, it is able to adapt itself to the overall
		system load, dynamically and quickly.
		
		The control of the used CPU amount is done sending SIGSTOP and SIGCONT
		POSIX signals to processes. All the children processes and threads of
		the specified process will share the same percentage of CPU.
