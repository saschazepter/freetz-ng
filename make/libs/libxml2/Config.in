config FREETZ_LIB_libxml2_WITH_EXTENDED_FEATURES
	bool "Build with extended features (non-minimal)"
	default n
	help
		Build libxml2 with extended XML features (--with-minimum=no).
		
		This enables additional XML features and APIs beyond the minimal
		build, but does not include HTML support (see separate option below).
		Required by some applications like PHP for full functionality.
		
		Size impact: Adds approximately 200-300 KB to libxml2.so
		
		Note: Automatically enabled by PHP if full XML support is requested.
		Disabling will build a minimal libxml2 (--with-minimum=yes) which
		may cause compatibility issues with some applications.

config FREETZ_LIB_libxml2_WITH_HTML
	bool "Build with HTML support"
	default n
	help
		Adds html parsing capability to libxml2. This increases the size of
		libxml2 by 120kB. Html parsing is required to build libxslt.

config FREETZ_LIB_libxml2_WITH_TREE
	bool "Build with tree manipulation API"
	default n
	help
		Enables the tree manipulation API in libxml2 (--with-tree=yes).
		This provides functions for creating, modifying, and traversing
		XML document trees.
		
		Required by:
		- XML Schema validation (--with-schemas)
		- PHP DOM extension
		- Applications that need to manipulate XML trees
		
		Size impact: Minimal (most code is already included in base build)
		
		Note: Automatically enabled by PHP when DOM support is requested.

config FREETZ_LIB_libxml2_WITH_RELAXNG
	bool "Build with Relax-NG support"
	default n
	help
		Enables Relax-NG schema validation support (--with-relaxng=yes).
		Relax-NG is an alternative to XML Schema for validating XML documents.
		
		Required by:
		- PHP's DOMDocument::relaxNGValidate() methods
		- Applications using Relax-NG validation
		
		Dependencies:
		- Requires --with-tree=yes (tree manipulation API)
		- Included in --with-schemas=yes (XML Schema support)
		
		Size impact: Adds approximately 50-80 KB to libxml2.so
		
		Note: Automatically enabled by PHP when DOM support is requested.
